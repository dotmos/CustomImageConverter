# CustomImageConverter
A super simple (read: hacky and ugly) custom image converter, which uses user created C# scripts to convert images.

Comes with examples to convert images to imagecontroller formats (color565 / ST7735, grayscale, monochrome) as well as a hacked-in monochrome dithering filter.
